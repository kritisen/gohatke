    > Jagriti Yatra is an annual train journey that that takes hundreds of India&#8217;s highly motivated youth (with some participation of international students) between the ages of 20-25 and experienced professionals with age above 25, on a eighteen day national odyssey, introducing them to unsung heroes of India. The aim is to awaken the spirit of entrepreneurship &#8211; both social and economic &#8211; within India&#8217;s youth by exposing them to individuals and institutions that are developing unique solutions to India&#8217;s challenges. Through this national event we have begun to inspire the youth of India to lead and develop institutions both nationally and within their communities.</ul>
