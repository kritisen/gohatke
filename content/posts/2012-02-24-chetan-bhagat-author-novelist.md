Now this story is the absolute master of all unconventional post-engineering careers. Chetan Bhagat became a household name with his bestselling book, Five Point Someone. Not only was it a great read &#8211; it was a book about life in an engineering college, and how the education system prefers stereotypes instead of innovative  
thinkers. The book influenced the movie, &#8216;3 Idiots&#8217;, which also delivered a great message for people to follow the career of their dreams.
