This is the most-watched talk of all TED talks. After watching it, you will have no doubt as to how / why this video reached the #1 spot. 

And it is completely relevant to the theme at GoHatke &#8212; Sir Robinson uses his tremendous sense of humour to explain a very serious topic: how schools kill creativity among children, and what can be done to counter that. A must watch if you have not already watched it &#8212; talks like these help shape world-views, and all school administrators and parents should watch it.
