Swapnil Kant Dixit (IIT Kharagpur, batch of 2005) was always unique in his thoughts and actions. While most students got stressed with exams, hostel duties, IIM/GRE applications &#8211; one would find Swapnil practicing for upcoming music / drama competitions&#8230; and winning them. After graduating with a B. Arch. degree, he joined/co-founded something completely unique &#8211; the Tata Jagriti Yatra, “an annual train journey that that takes hundreds of India’s highly motivated youth (&#8230;) between the ages of 20-25 and experienced professionals with age above 25, on a eighteen day national odyssey, introducing them to unsung heroes of India.”

The enthusiasm of Swapnil is contagious, and one needs to hear him speak to understand that there is so much more that Swapnil will achieve in the upcoming years.
