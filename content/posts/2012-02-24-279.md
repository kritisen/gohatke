&#8220;Amway is not something which is for engineers&#8221;. This was the sort of impression Bhomesh Sharma had about Amway in 2006. However, a chance meeting led Bhomesh to realize that people from top engineering schools in India (e.g. IIT-s) and the world (e.g. Stanford) were members at Amway. Also he realized Amway was not a escape route for people who were unsuccessful in their regular careers &#8211; there were people who were CEO-s at their company and yet chose to be a part of Amway. Through a network called Britt World Wide, Bhomesh was able to learn the ropes of starting an Amway business from scratch. The money is good &#8211; he is totally debt-free now (he had INR 6.5 lakh loan when he graduated from college). But that is not the only thing &#8211; Amway allows Bhomesh to utilize to the max, a part of his persona that his day job does not utilize that much: his love for communicating and working with people. &#8220;You meet wonderful people, and are able to touch their lives in wonderful ways&#8221; &#8211; this is what Bhomesh now feels about his second career.
