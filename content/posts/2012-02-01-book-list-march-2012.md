#### The Game Changers: 20 Extraordinary Success Stories Of Entrepreneurs From IIT Kharagpur &#8212; Yuvnesh Modi , Rahul Kumar , Alok Kothari

_A one of a kind book about IITs most successful entrepreneurs.</p> 

Entrepreneurship is not about breaking free from the 9 to 5 humdrum, not about being your own boss, and definitely not glorious. The entrepreneur shuns the comfort of a cushy corporate job and six figure salaries to set sail on unchartered waters with a single minded zeal and only an idea as an anchor. But it is this idea and passion that makes all the difference and catapults them into a world of infinite possibilities. The Game Changers brings to you 20 success stories of IITians who went on to live the big dream.</em>
