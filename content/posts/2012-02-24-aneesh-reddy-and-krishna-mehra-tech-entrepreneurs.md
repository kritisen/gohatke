Now this one is one of the most conventional careers among engineers &#8211; i.e. opening a tech startup. However only a handful dare to take the entrepreneurial route. Most remain content by doing jobs. Yet a big salute must go out to people who go that extra mile to &#8220;create jobs&#8221; instead.

[Aneesh Reddy and Krishna Mehra][2] stand out in the entrepreneurial space. Their company, Capillary Technologies, is poised to be one of the fastest growing companies in India and the world. They were listed by Times of India among top 15 people in 2011 most likely to be the next Narayan Murthy of India.
