Let&#8217;s face it. Many of us yearn to do something outside our 9-5 job. Some of us want to open their own business, some want to write a novel, some just want to paint beautiful paintings. So many times, the artist / writer / entrepreneur hiding in us gets lost and never gets a chance to shine forth. To avoid this in our personal lives, it is extremely helpful to draw inspiration from people who faced similar challenges and overcame them.

There is no limit to what a person can achieve. For example, an engineer may decide that he/she wants to be a novelist. And absurd though it may seem, thanks to Mr. Chetan Bhagat, every Indian now knows this is possible.

So in this spirit, let us list 10 things an engineer can decide to be. (Simultaneously, we list 10 example of people who followed each unconventional career.)
