### Today, I ask you to take a small step &#8212; Ask me a question.

Ask me anything that comes to your mind when you think about pursuing your career aspirations. I will answer as best as I can. But my answer is not what is most important. Your asking the question is important, as it can help change your life (one small step at a time).

  <h3>
    How can a question change your life?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    A mere stringing together of a few words.. at first glance, a question does not seem that potent a thing. Yet, a question has enormous power &#8212; it has the ability to influence your future.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In 2009, during an internship in Silicon Valley, a question came to my mind &#8212; can there be more to life and career than the conventional way followed by most of us (go to college, get a job, keep working for promotions)?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That simple question changed my life. And five years henceforth, I feel all the better for it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I look forward to hearing from you.
