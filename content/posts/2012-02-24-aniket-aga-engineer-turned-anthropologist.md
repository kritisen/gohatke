Aniket Aga was one of the toppers in his batch of Electronics at IIT Kharagpur. That is no mean feat considering that many top All India Rankers of IIT-JEE join the Electronics department and competition is super-tough. So it was surprising when one of his favorite subjects during his B. Tech. was a subject called “Human Behaviour in Organizations”. While most people showed obvious disinterest on such “forced-upon” electives, Aniket loved this subject and regularly used to have lengthy discussions with the course Professor.

After his B. Tech., Aniket joined McKinsey Inc. at their Bombay office and stayed there for 1 year. Then he decided to do something completely radical &#8211; he started a PhD on a completely unrelated topic – Organizational Behaviour at University of Southern California. Later, in 2009, when USC denied his wish to write his dissertation on an Indian topic, he refused to comply with that. Instead he switched to Yale University and is currently working on his thesis there.

Aniket is truly a scholar &#8211; and that too in diverse subjects such as Electronics and Human Behaviour.
