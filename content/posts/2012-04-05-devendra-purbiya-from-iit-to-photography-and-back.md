<p style="font-size:large;">
  Devendra Purbiya&#8217;s first book &#8220;Illuminati: The Engineering of Illumination&#8221; is available online and in stores. Here is the description of the book at the Flipkart online store:
</p>

&#8220;Illu is artistic, big, grand and huge. It also burns lakhs of rupees in a few minutes! But that’s not what Illu should be known for. To an outsider not associated with IIT Kharagpur, Illu or Illumination is an enigma. “It must be their college fest – these IITians like to keep fancy names,” some say. But Illu is a celebration of Diwali on campus, and a very hatke celebration at that. It is an eye-opening journey, an experience that lets every IIT KGP-ian go back to campus every year. The aim of this book has been to cover the entire landscape of Illu, and the photographer has been able to paint the picture with as much attention to fine detail as to the panorama.&#8221;

<p style="font-size:large;">
  And here is what a reader (Mr. Subrat Kumar Panda) had to say at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IlluminatiTheEngineeringOfIllumination">the book&#8217;s Facebook page</a>:
</p>

_&#8220;For the first time, after leaving KGP &#8211; did I ever live the Illumination experience so completely. It was just awesome &#8211; first of all to have read the foreword from a person I respect from the core of my heart &#8211; PPC. The making of the chatais, loops, rangolis all are very well picturized, documented and described. The endless nights that we had to spend working hard for the evaluation day &#8211; I could relate with every page of the book. The text written around is great &#8211; done justice to the clicks &#8211; but words will be words &#8211; they sometimes are limited and the joy and the ecstatic feeling of being part of such a big event cannot be described in words. I would strongly recommend any KGPian to get a copy of this book. It is available on flipkart as well. Lastly, Illuminati &#8211; will help you keep the memories of KGP in your heart forever. Rightly said, The Engineering of Illumination.&#8221;_
