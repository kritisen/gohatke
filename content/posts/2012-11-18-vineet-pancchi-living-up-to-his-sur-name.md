For ages, man has aspired to fly free like a bird. Through the unique story of his life and career, Mr. Vineet Pancchi <span style="text-decoration: underline;">has</span> achieved that dream.

[And because of this, it is extremely uncanny thatÂ &#8216;_Pancchi_&#8216; in Hindi means &#8216;bird&#8217;.]

Now to the backstory of how I learned about Vineet&#8217;s career. Through Pallavi Barat Prabhu&#8217;s Google+ share, I chanced upon the song &#8212; &#8220;[Ghanta Kuch Yaad Nahi Hai&#8230;Jo Padha Vo Bhool Gaye | Pusa Underground Music][2]&#8221; [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Warning</span>: Contains some obscene language.]

Now my full respect would already be with anyone associated with the making of this song. Anyway after listening to the song a couple of times, I started out to see if the person who had uploaded this song had more such gems lined up. That is when I learned of Vineet&#8217;s career story.

It all started out in Dehradun with the hopes and aspirations of a typical small-town family. Vineet&#8217;s parents wanted their son to study hard and land up a good job (&#8220;_padh-likh kar bada ban jaaye_&#8220;). However Vineet loved his idyllic home-town too much to leave it. He spent a lot of time playing music with his school band. In the end, his parents&#8217; wishes were honored &#8212; Vineet left Dehradun for bigger cities. in the search of success and a &#8216;safer&#8217; future.

And succeed he did. Vineet&#8217;s rise up the career ladder is evident from the list of job-positions he held. In chronological order [Ref: [LinkedIn][3]], they were:

  1. Store Manager/ Area Manager
  2. Audio Equipment Sales
  3. Training Manager
  4. Assistant Vice President
  5. Director HR
  6. Director HR India
  7. Group Vice President &#8211; HR

Now all these jobs were in the New Delhi or Gurgaon area. Vineet had made it big in the city. But after 15 years of city life and climbing the corporate ladder, he realized that his heart lay elsewhere &#8212; in Dehradun.

Here Vineet&#8217;s real story begins. He bade good-bye to the big metropolis of New Delhi, and moved back to his beautiful hometown Dehradun. But that meant he had to leave his career behind. And at the same time, Vineet needed to keep earning (he was not super rich nor could he retire and live off his savings). He needed to keep earning. 

And that is when he did something really silly (at least that is what pundits would say). He used up all his savings, and opened up a world class recording studio right in Dehradun. A studio in Bombay or Bangalore would be considered a normal business move. But why would anyone open a recording studio in Dehradun! Where would one find the talent to make good music! And more importantly, where would the clients come from?

Well, as it so turned out, that decades after Vineet had left his home-town, the story of high-schoolers in Dehradun was still quite the same. Parents still wanted their kids to migrate to big cities in search of safer careers. Kids like Vineet, who had big dreams of their own, had to swallow the pill and follow their parents&#8217; wishes. But now, with Vineet&#8217;s recording studio, things were about to change.

Vineet&#8217;s studio started producing jingles for radio stations. He started recruiting local talent for creating the jingles. Some colleagues (from his New Delhi days) started collaborating with him. And with the power of the Internet (Vineet had to contact a local MLA to ensure that his studio and office got a high speed Internet connection), these jingles went viral. And soon enough the company started making profits, and started receiving a steady stream of clients.

Today Vineet&#8217;s [company][4] is nationally recognized. His life has come full circle. Dehradun to Delhi in search of jobs. And now back to Dehradun as a job-creator. 

Now many more Dehradun-ians can aspire for such dreams. 

After all, <u>big</u> dreams of <u>small</u>-town folks can also come true.
