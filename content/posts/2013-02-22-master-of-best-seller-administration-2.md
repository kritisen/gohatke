    In my previous article, I wrote about the interesting phenomenon that so many Indian novelists are graduates from famous universities.  Well, after I wrote the article, I kept thinking: "What would the best-selling authors say if they read this article? Would they agree about my findings?"
    
    So I thought I would try to to find exactly that out. So I tried to connect with the writers featured in my article through email, Twitter, or any (legal) means possible.

In my previous article, &#8220;[Master of Best-seller Administration &#8230;][1]&#8220;, I wrote about the interesting phenomenon that so many Indian novelists are graduates from famous universities. Why is this so? &#8212; I thought.

And I came to the following conclusions (listed in brief here. For the &#8220;Full Monty&#8221;, go read [here][2]):

  * **Hard work** is a must&#8230;
  * **Self discipline** is key&#8230;
  * A** stable career** is a rock solid pillar to support one&#8217;s writing endeavors&#8230;
  * **Networking** helps&#8230;
  * **Money** is helpful too&#8230;

Well, after I wrote the article, I kept thinking: &#8220;What would the best-selling authors say if they read this article? **Would they agree?**&#8221;

<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">1. Aswhin Sanghi&#8217;s reply</span>

First, I heard back from Ashwin Sanghi, best-selling author or &#8220;Chanakya&#8217;s Chant&#8221; and &#8220;The Rozabal Line&#8221;. Here&#8217;s what he had to say:

<div class="post-content-box-yellow">
  <p>
    &#8220;Dear Kriti,Thanks for writing to me. I was also happy to see your article on your website.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My schedule is a taxing one because I continue to work Monday thru Friday for 40 hours per week. I write each morning between 6am and 10am. Saturdays are days that I devote to research and Sundays are devoted to reading. I rarely socialize and am usually in bed by 11pm most nights. To answer your question: there is no substitute for hard work.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Best wishes,<br /> Warmly,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ashwin&#8221;
  </p>
</div>

Thanks Ashwin for your reply. And for confirming that hard work is so important.

<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">2. Arnab Ray&#8217;s reply</span>

Next, after a bit of prodding (Sorry for that Arnab Da), I heard back from Arnab Ray (blogger at [greatbong.net][4], and author of &#8220;The Mine&#8221;). Here&#8217;s what he had to say:

<div class="post-content-box-gray">
  &#8220;Hard work is important in any endeavor, especially if you are trying to support a serious hobby while doing your dayjob. The difference between a serious hobby and just-a-hobby is that a serious hobby comes with responsibilities like commitments made to people to provide an article or to return with edits. Just-a-hobby is what you do when you have free-time. So serious hobbyists (and I take a more general position than writing&#8212;this could be anything: painting, taking wedding photographs, volunteering for social work) have to prioritize, manage time and have, and this is perhaps the most important word, discipline.&#8221;
</div>

Once again, the central theme &#8212; **discipline**.

## 3. Article by world-famous blogger Joe Bunting

Then I chanced upon a fantastic explanation of the importance of hard work and practise in the field of writing. This is from Joe Bunting, best-selling author and creator of &#8220;[The Write Practice][5]&#8220;, consistently voted one of the top blogs for writing in the world:

<div class="post-content-box-blue">
  <p>
    &#8220;(Geoffrey) Colvin (senior editor at-large at CNN) talked about an exper­i­ment done amongst 20-year-old vio­lin­ists. &#8220;The best group,&#8221; he says, &#8220;aver­aged 10,000 hours of delib­er­ate prac­tice over their lives; the next-best aver­aged 7,500 hours; and the next, 5,000.&#8221;I was stung by it. &#8220;How much have I prac­ticed writ­ing in this way?&#8221; I thought. &#8220;Deliberate, mea­sured prac­tice, get­ting feed­back from others?&#8221;
  </p>
</div>

The [article by Geoffrey Colvin][6] has the header:

> What it takes to be great. Research now shows that the lack of natural talent is irrelevant to great success. The secret? Painful and demanding practice and hard work.

And Joe Bunting&#8217;s blog &#8220;[The Write Practice][5]&#8221; goes one step further and helps the reader by designing methodologies for delberate, measured practise in the field of writing. Do check it out.

## Final verdict about my article

The Masters agree &#8212; hard-work, discipline, and practice (i.e. all the boring stuff) are of paramount importance in the field of writing too!
