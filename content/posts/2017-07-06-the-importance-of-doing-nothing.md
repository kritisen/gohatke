An extremely long read (something to be read when you have spare time), but very rewarding:

Some of my favorite quotes from the article

> &#8220;I’m reminded of a 1991 lecture by John Cleese (of Monty Python) on creativity, in which two of the five required factors he lists are time &#8212; 
> 
> 1. Space  
> 2. Time  
> 3. Time  
> 4. Confidence  
> 5. <del>A 22 inch waist</del> Humor&#8221; 

> &#8220;At the time, in 2011, I surprisingly didn’t have a phone with email yet, and when this happened I saw the writing on the wall and put off getting one even longer. I knew exactly what would happen the minute I did, that every minute of every day I would in fact be answerable to someone, even if my leash was a lot longer.&#8221;

> &#8220;This is real. The living, breathing bodies in this room are real. I am not an avatar, a set of preferences, or some smooth cognitive force. I’m lumpy, I’m an animal, I hurt sometimes, and I’m different one day to the next.&#8221;

> “Being a mother entails an enormous amount of repetitive tasks. I became a maintenance worker. I felt completely abandoned by my culture because it didn’t have a way to incorporate sustaining work.” &#8230; 1969 Maintenance Manifesto is actually an exhibition proposal in which she considers her own maintenance work as the art. She says, “I will live in the museum and do what I customarily do at home with my husband and my baby, for the duration of the exhibition … My work is the work.”
