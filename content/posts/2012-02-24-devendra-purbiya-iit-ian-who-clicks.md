Devendra Purbiya completed his engineering degree from IIT Kharagpur, and landed up with a highly prestigious (a.k.a. well paying) job. But there was an artist lurking within him, that hated sitting in front of a computer from 9 to 5. Devendra&#8217;s artistic skills had been visible in Kharagpur where he was always in the Design team for the highly coveted Illumination and Rangoli competitions. After graduation, Devendra picked up photography &#8211; and hundreds of Facebook likes and Flickr comments later, he realized he was really good at it. He quit his job in 2010 and became a full-time photographer. He has won several accolades, and we can safely say that his current job is also quite prestigious ðŸ˜‰ (see reference above if you did not get the joke).
