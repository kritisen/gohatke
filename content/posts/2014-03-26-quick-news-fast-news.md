![Quick fast news](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kritisen/gohatke/main/content/images/2012/12/6829349175_7fca760931_z.jpg)

## First, ask yourself the following questions:

  * Are you the kind of person, who keeps saying to yourself,  
    _**&#8220;I know I should be keeping up with the news, but I just don&#8217;t find the time!&#8221;**_
  * Do you get your fix of world news from what your friends share on Facebook?
  * Do you want to know the best online resources for following world news?

If you answered **YES** to any of these questions, then this article is definitely for you.

In this article, you will get _step-by-step instructions_ to follow world news in a quick and easy fashion.

But before we delve into the details, you must learn the basics first. You must learn&#8230;

> **the three secrets to world (news) domination.**

## THE THREE SECRETS

## Secret # I. Get regular

![Hexágono_regular](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kritisen/gohatke/main/content/images/2012/12/Hex%C3%A1gono_regular.png)

<p style="text-align: center;">
  The first secret is darn simple &#8212; &#8220;<em>Get regular.</em>&#8220;
</p>

By this, I mean that you need to get regular about following the news i.e. you need to fix times during the day when you would be tuning into your preferred news outlets (thus building your very own &#8216;**news regimen**&#8216;)

For starts, here is a sample news-reading regimen (click through to the relevant sections for more details):

  1. Listen to a 5-minute news bulletin ([Step 1][3]) at a set time every day &#8212; on the drive to office, during the cool-down time at gym, while doing chores etc..
  2. Listen to TED-radio hour ([Step 5][4]) or other long-form programming ([Step 4][5]) on long drives, in layover between planes etc.
  3. When in the mood for something light, listen to a program like &#8220;[Wait Wait Don&#8217;t Tell Me][6]&#8220;, that allows you to have some fun, while making sure you learn something in the process.

## Secret # II. Get passive

![GetPassive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kritisen/gohatke/main/content/images/2014/03/getPassive.png)

The second secret involves the trick of passive news-reading.

&#8216;Passive&#8217; news-reading is the act of following news along with some low-concentration activity e.g. listening to news on online radio while cooking/jogging/driving ([Step 1][3]), watching your favorite news program while on the treadmill etc.

## Secret # III. Get sub-conscious (with &#8216;stream of consciousness reading&#8217;)

![getSubconscious](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kritisen/gohatke/main/content/images/2014/03/getSubconscious.png)

Stream of consciousness reading is a super powerful trick for following news.

_Here&#8217;s how to go about it:_ When your are in front of your computer at office, but are absolutely tired to do something productive, use  that down-time by random but directed browsing of news sources e.g. browsing the LinkedIn app ([Step 6][9]), Twitter ([Step 8][10]), or going through those piled up email newsletters ([Step 7][11]).

Because you are not using your full attention at this activity, it may seem useless at first. But stick to it for some time, and you are sure to reap the subconscious benefits soon.

## THE TEN STEPS TO QUICK NEWS

Now that you know the basics, let&#8217;s get down and dirty with the&#8230;

> The TEN steps to &#8220;quick news&#8221;

![radio_small](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kritisen/gohatke/main/content/images/2013/10/001_radio_small.jpg)

Don&#8217;t read news. Listen to it.

Listen to news via online radio (online radio is radio that you can stream to your PC / smart-phone)

  <p>
    <strong>Some tips and tricks</strong>:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      This step is completely area specific. Some searches that I did recently: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big+data+blogs" target="_blank">&#8216;big data blog&#8217;</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=best+writing+blogs" target="_blank">best writing blogs</a> &#8230;
    </li>
    <li>
      When in doubt, &#8216;<em><b>unsubscribe</b></em>&#8216; (every email newsletter worth its salt will have an unsubscribe link embedded in it).
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

## 8. Use Twitter {#Step_Twitter}

<div class="post-content-box-gray">
  <p>
    <strong>Some tips and tricks</strong>:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      You can tune your Twitter feed the way you want to &#8212; <strong><em>Follow</em></strong> people you like listening to, <strong><em>Unfollow</em></strong> when you get bored.
    </li>
    <li>
      Twitter is the ultimate &#8216;<em>stream of consciousness</em>&#8216; news-source. Don&#8217;t get &#8220;<em>uber whelmed</em>&#8221; &#8212; come in and go as you like.
    </li>
    <li>
      There&#8217;s always something news-worthy here, unless, of course, you start keeping up with the <a href="https://twitter.com/KimKardashian" target="_blank">Kardashians</a>. <b>Case in point</b>: Follow the right people.
